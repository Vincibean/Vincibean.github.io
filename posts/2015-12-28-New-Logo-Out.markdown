Thanks to Christmas holidays, I finally managed to customize a bit this blog and, more importantly, to create [my own Logo](../assets/img/2016-07-26/event-timeline.png).   
It is heavily influenced by the illustrations that Leonardo da Vinci (yes, that's where the "Vinci" in "Vincibean" come from) drew for [Luca Pacioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Pacioli)'s [*De divina proportione*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_divina_proportione). In this book on mathematics, Luca Pacioli and Leonardo da Vinci describe mathematical proportions (golden ratio in particular) and their applications to geometry.     
The logo is inspired by the fact that the boundaries of three mutually-perpendicular golden rectangles, if linked, form a regular icosahedron.  
The overall theme is designed to resemble IntelliJ's Darcula theme.
