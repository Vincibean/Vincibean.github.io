<p>Oddly enough, one of the most rewarding activities for a software developer (or for me, at least) is creating software with little to no coding effort. Probably, it’s due to the intrinsic laziness I have to deal with. In this sense, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is great: it allows you to build minimal, static blogs to be hosted on GitHub.<br />
A vibrant community flourished around it, and this blog owe a great deal to it. In particular, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/barryclark/">Barry Clark</a> wrote a great <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">article</a> explaining how to build a blog with Jekyll and GitHub.<br />
In summary, this task is accomplished by forking one of the many Jekyll-powered repositories and storing your fork on GitHub, but Barry goes even further, explaining how to avoid common problems, how to import content from your WordPress, how to use your own domain name, how to theme in Jekyll, and explaining a couple of Jekyll 2.0’s new features.<br />
This very same blog was created following his article, so thanks are in order!<br />
Go read his article if you can!</p>
