As tradition has it, the first post HAS to be a "Hello World".  
This is my personal site, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on top of [GitHub](https://github.com/) (yeah, I know: everybody already knows GitHub, so this last link wasn't required at all; truth is, I'm trying to become confident with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax!).  
I'm going to fill this blog with everything that, as a software developer (and geek), I find interesting and/or not-too-well-described on the net, and I'll try to keep it simple and fun.
